				"text": "Franco gets top marks for customer service, he understands the client/vendor expectation and dynamic very well. He is very considerate and patient and imparts his ample product knowledge with ease which offers much confidence in his abilities, and he gets the job done properly and within a professional deadline. Id give him an extra 6th star for not trying to talk me into a new phone, as repairs to my iPhone 12 mini were well and truly on par with a second hand replacement. Hence, Franco understood my insurance paperwork requirements as he understood my reluctance to replace my iPhone 12 mini, which had not been superseded with a current model. He also deals in OEM and refurbished parts which was a standout amongst other vendors. I‚Äôd be happy to recommend his services to my friends and colleagues.",

				"text": "Very hard to find someone who does good quality work that is fast and cheap. I know where I‚Äôm going next time I have an issue with my phone. Had a faulty screen put on that he replaced the next day for no charge and gave me a free screen protector for the inconvenience. Replaced my screen and battery in less than an hour, where any other shop that I‚Äôve been to have taken multiple hours. Great work highly recommend and I will be back mate üôè",
