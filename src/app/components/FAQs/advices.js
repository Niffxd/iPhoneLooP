    title: "I've broken the back of my iPhone, can you repair just the glass?",
    describe: "We do not offer just the rear glass repair on an iPhone. This is because the rear glass contains an Apple logo, the glass which is used in the industry is either counterfeit or does not contain an Apple logo. Glass which contains an Apple logo is an infringement of Apple's copyright. We offer a full housing repair which is the frame of the iPhone and the rear glass. It is a disassembled part from a new or used iPhone, this way we confirm it is an original part and not an infringement of Apple's copyright. If you were to have a back glass fitted without an Apple logo it would immediately devalue your iPhone when you come to sell it or trade it in. We would absolutely advise against having a no logo glass fitted. It's one of our red flags when it comes to choosing a repair company for your iPhone.",

    title: "My rear camera lens is cracked, do I need a camera repair too?",
    describe: "Provided the lens is only cracked and not completely shattered it is likely that you would just need a lens replacement. When there is a hole in the lens, dust particles and other debris can damage the sensor underneath and it is in these cases that you would need a rear camera replacement. You can check if your sensor is damaged by aiming your camera at a white, bright surface, if there are grey dots or marks on what should be a white image, then your sensor is likely damaged. If you are unsure, our customer advisor teams will be able to tell you when we receive the device.",
